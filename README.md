# Suno AI API

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README_CN.md)

Use API to call the music generation service of Suno.ai and easily integrate it into agents like GPTs.

## Introduction

Suno.ai v3 is an amazing AI music service. Although the official API is not yet available, we couldn't wait to integrate its capabilities somewhere.

We discovered that some users have similar needs, so we decided to open-source this project, hoping you'll like it.

## Features

- Perfectly implements the creation API from app.suno.ai
- Supports Custom Mode
- One-click deployment to Vercel
- In addition to the standard API, it also adapts to the API Schema of Agent platforms like GPTs and Coze, so you can use it as a tool/plugin/Action for LLMs and integrate it into any AI Agent.
- Permissive open-source license, allowing you to freely integrate and modify.

## Demo

We have deployed an example bound to a free Suno account, so it has daily usage limits, but you can see how it runs:
